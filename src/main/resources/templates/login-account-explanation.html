        While we at PressPlayVideo pride ourselves on knowing our customers personally, over the internet it can be much harder to have that same rapport. Because of this, we've created a system that helps us get to know you as you use our website. To do this, we need you to register as a customer online, and during this process you'll be asked four quick questions:
    </p>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <div class="paragraph-spacer"></div>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
        - The first is a <b>Username</b>. This is the name that you would like to be known by on this website. Make sure to write this down as you'll need to remember it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <div class="paragraph-spacer"></div>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
        - Next is a <b>Password</b>. This is a secret word or phrase that only you and the website know. Make sure to write this one down as well.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <div class="paragraph-spacer"></div>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
        - The next is your <b>Address</b>. We've always known our customers primarily by their addresses, and going online won't change that.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <div class="paragraph-spacer"></div>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">
        - And finally, we'll need to know your <b>Home store</b>. This is the PressPlay store that you usually visit.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="spacer-div"></div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
        Once you've registered, all you'll need to do from now on is "log in": When asked, write down your <b> Username </b> and <b> Password </b>. This will let the computer remember who you are.
